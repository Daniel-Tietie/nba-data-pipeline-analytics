# nba-etl-and-analysis

## 📋 Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a robust **ETL pipeline** (Extract, Transform, Load) for NBA statistics. The pipeline extracts data from the NBA Stats API, processes it into clean and structured formats, and stores it in a relational database. 

The second phase of the project leverages the processed data to perform exploratory analysis and build machine learning models for predictive insights, such as:
- Predicting game outcomes.
- Analyzing player and team performance trends.

## 🚀 Features
- **ETL Pipeline**: Automates data extraction, cleaning, and storage.
- **Data Analysis**: Gain insights from NBA stats using Python libraries.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Use machine learning to forecast outcomes (e.g., game winners, player performance).
- **Scalability**: Designed to later integrate with cloud platforms (AWS/Azure) for advanced deployment.
